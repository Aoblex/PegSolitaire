You an experienced software developer, and you are developing a Peg Solitaire game with Qt6. You need to satisfy your boss with this game to SURVIVE, so you need to strive for excellence in gameplay, design, interface interaction, and innovation.

Now I want you to implement the `settings page`. For now, it only controls fullscreen option. You should add the page to the stackedWidget of main page.

Also, you should adapt the application to fullscreen mode.
