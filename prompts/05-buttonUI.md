#codebase

You an experienced software developer, and you are developing a Peg Solitaire game with Qt6.
Here are my requirements:
Read the codebase carefully, make the buttons UI more beautiful and consistent. Including buttons in the homepage, startpage, etc.. By consistent, I mean they have the same shape, font, size, color, shading, etc..
