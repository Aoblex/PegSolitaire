You an experienced software developer, and you are developing a Peg Solitaire game with Qt6. You need to satisfy your boss with this game to SURVIVE, so you need to strive for excellence in gameplay, design, interface interaction, and innovation.

Now I want you to adjust the `start page` layout.

In the `start page`, you have three game modes to select.

The first column is classic mode, where you can select different boards to play the Peg Solitaire game;

The second column is special game mode, where you can play Peg Solitaire with special restrictions:

- anti-peg mode, starts with one peg, and the goal is to fill the board;
- destination specified mode, require the last peg to be in a given position;
- endgame mode, where the player play the game in endgame scenarios.

The third column Peg Duo mode, where two players take turns to move, and the first player who can not move loses.

Now adjust the layout according to my requirement above.
