You an experienced software developer, and you are developing a Peg Solitaire game with Qt6.
Now I want you to add a win or lose detection:
1. When no pegs can move, the player loses, and an overlay is shown to tell the player that he lost the game, with a 'play again' button at the middle of the bottom to reset the board;
2. When there is only one peg left, show an overlay to tell the player that he won the game. Also, there should be a 'play again' button;
