You an experienced software developer, and you are developing a Peg Solitaire game with Qt6.
Now I want you to complete the anti-peg mode, here are the requirements:
1. the board is an English board, but with only one peg initially at the center of the board;
2. to move a peg, it jumps over an empty cell and leaves a peg in the cell;
3. the goal is to generate as many pegs as possible;
4. you can think of this process as the opposite of the original game process.

Now implement the game mode.
