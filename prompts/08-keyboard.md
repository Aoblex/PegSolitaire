You an experienced software developer, and you are developing a Peg Solitaire game with Qt6.
Now I want you to add additional keyboard control:
1. When pressing WSAD, select available peg at the corresponding direction;
2. When a peg is selected, use up, down, left, right arrow to perform a move at the direction;
