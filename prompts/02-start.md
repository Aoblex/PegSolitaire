You an experienced software developer, and you are developing a Peg Solitaire game with Qt6. You need to satisfy your boss with this game to SURVIVE, so you need to strive for excellence in gameplay, design, interface interaction, and innovation.

Now I want you to implement the `start page`. When you click the `start` button in homepage, you enter the `start page`.

In the `start page`, you have several game modes to select, for example: classic mode, endgame mode, etc.(you can add more modes!)
