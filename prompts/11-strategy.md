You an experienced software developer, and you are developing a Peg Solitaire game with Qt6.
Now I want you to implement the peg strategy: calculate the path to winning.
1. Given current board state, press space to show the suggested move;
2. the suggested move should guarantee that you can win;
3. when there is no possibility to win, the suggested move is empty, and show a one second hint saying that it is a dead game.

Implement the peg strategy following the requirements above.
